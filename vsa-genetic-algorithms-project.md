## Executive Summary

This research introduces the first evolutionary algorithm operating natively in hyperdimensional space using Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). By representing individuals as hypervectors and implementing genetic operators through VSA operations, we enable evolution in 10,000+ dimensional spaces while maintaining meaningful genetic operations. This approach solves the curse of dimensionality that plagues traditional GAs in high-dimensional optimization and enables novel capabilities like compositional problem-solving and cross-problem transfer learning.

## Background and Motivation

### The High-Dimensional Optimization Crisis
Traditional genetic algorithms fail in high dimensions due to:
- Exponential growth of search space
- Loss of selection pressure
- Crossover becoming increasingly disruptive
- Mutation requiring careful scaling

### Why VSA Changes Everything
- **Implicit regularization** through hyperdimensional representation
- **Compositional structure** enables meaningful high-D crossover
- **Similarity preservation** maintains population diversity naturally
- **No existing work** combines VSA with evolutionary computation

### Open Research Problem
The 2022 Frontiers Research Topic "Brain-Inspired Hyperdimensional Computing" explicitly identified combining HDC with evolutionary algorithms as a major unsolved challenge.

## Technical Approach

### Minimal VSA-GA for Rapid Prototyping

```python
# Simplest possible VSA-GA for quick results
import numpy as np

class MinimalVSAGA:
    def __init__(self, dim=10000, pop_size=50):
        self.dim = dim
        self.pop_size = pop_size
        
    def encode_solution(self, x):
        """Encode real vector as hypervector"""
        # Simple: discretize and create binary hypervector
        # Each dimension gets dim/len(x) bits
        bits_per_dim = self.dim // len(x)
        hv = np.zeros(self.dim)
        
        for i, val in enumerate(x):
            # Map value to binary pattern
            pattern = self.value_to_pattern(val, bits_per_dim)
            hv[i*bits_per_dim:(i+1)*bits_per_dim] = pattern
            
        return np.sign(hv)  # Binary hypervector
    
    def decode_solution(self, hv):
        """Decode hypervector back to solution"""
        # Inverse of encoding
        n_vars = 100  # For 100-D problems
        bits_per_dim = self.dim // n_vars
        x = []
        
        for i in range(n_vars):
            pattern = hv[i*bits_per_dim:(i+1)*bits_per_dim]
            value = self.pattern_to_value(pattern)
            x.append(value)
            
        return np.array(x)
    
    def vsa_crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
        """Crossover via bundling"""
        # Weighted superposition
        child = np.sign(0.6 * parent1 + 0.4 * parent2 + 0.01 * np.random.randn(self.dim))
        return child
    
    def vsa_mutate(self, hv, rate=0.01):
        """Mutation via bit flipping"""
        mask = np.random.random(self.dim) < rate
        hv[mask] *= -1
        return hv
    
    def evolve_rastrigin(self, n_dims=1000, generations=100):
        """Solve high-dimensional Rastrigin"""
        # Initialize population
        pop = [np.random.choice([-1, 1], self.dim) for _ in range(self.pop_size)]
        
        for gen in range(generations):
            # Decode and evaluate
            solutions = [self.decode_solution(hv) for hv in pop]
            fitness = [self.rastrigin(x) for x in solutions]
            
            # Selection and reproduction
            new_pop = []
            for _ in range(self.pop_size):
                # Tournament selection
                p1 = pop[np.argmin(np.random.choice(fitness, 3))]
                p2 = pop[np.argmin(np.random.choice(fitness, 3))]
                
                # Create offspring
                child = self.vsa_crossover(p1, p2)
                child = self.vsa_mutate(child)
                new_pop.append(child)
            
            pop = new_pop
            
            if gen % 10 == 0:
                print(f"Gen {gen}: Best = {min(fitness):.2f}")
        
        return min(fitness)
```

## Rapid Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Proof (Days 1-2)

```python
# Day 1: Get it working on something
def day1_test():
    vsa_ga = MinimalVSAGA(dim=10000, pop_size=30)
    
    # Test on 100-D Sphere function first (easier)
    result = vsa_ga.evolve_sphere(n_dims=100)
    print(f"100-D Sphere: {result}")
    
    # Then try 1000-D
    result = vsa_ga.evolve_sphere(n_dims=1000)
    print(f"1000-D Sphere: {result}")

# Day 2: Benchmark comparison
def day2_benchmark():
    # Compare VSA-GA vs CMA-ES vs Random Search
    dimensions = [10, 100, 1000, 5000, 10000]
    
    for d in dimensions:
        vsa_result = vsa_ga.solve(rastrigin, d)
        cmaes_result = cmaes.solve(rastrigin, d) if d < 1000 else "FAILED"
        print(f"{d}-D: VSA={vsa_result:.2f}, CMA-ES={cmaes_result}")
```

### Phase 2: Evidence Building (Days 3-4)

**Essential Experiments:**
1. Scaling plot: Performance vs dimensions [10, 100, 1000, 10000]
2. Benchmark suite: Rastrigin, Ackley, Schwefel

## Claude Code Sprint Prompts

### Day 1 - Basic VSA-GA
```
Implement a minimal VSA-based genetic algorithm:
- 10,000-dimensional binary hypervectors
- Population of 50 individuals
- Crossover: weighted average then binarize
- Mutation: flip 1% of bits randomly
- Test on 100-D and 1000-D Sphere function
Goal: Show it works at high dimensions
Keep under 200 lines of code.
```

### Day 2 - Benchmark Comparison
```
Compare VSA-GA to baselines on Rastrigin function:
- Dimensions: [10, 100, 1000, 10000]
- Baselines: CMA-ES (use pycma), random search
- Show CMA-ES fails above 1000-D while VSA-GA continues
- Generate scaling plot: dimension vs best fitness
- Add Ackley and Schwefel functions
```

### Days 5-7 - Paper Writing
```
Write a paper about Hyperdimensional Evolutionary Algorithms.

- TMLR always available

### Technical shortcuts:
- Use simple encoding/decoding initially
- Test only on continuous optimization
- Implement minimal GA features
- Focus on scaling demonstration

## Unique Advantages

### For HDC/VSA Workshop:

## Quick Win Strategy

**If you can show by Sept 14th that:**
1. VSA-GA solves 10,000-D Rastrigin
2. CMA-ES fails at this scale
3. Performance scales linearly

**Then:** Submit abstract to ICLR immediately

**Otherwise:** Focus on workshop, which gives you 5 weeks to:
- Polish implementation
- Add more experiments
- Write careful paper
- Build community connections

## Contact and Collaboration

This research opens an entirely new direction in evolutionary computation. The first demonstration of evolution in hyperdimensional space could transform how we approach high-dimensional optimization. Seeking collaboration with both the HDC/VSA and evolutionary computation communities.
